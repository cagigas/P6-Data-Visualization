# Make Effective Data Visualization


## Summary

We can see the most important data from Titanic Disaster.This data set contains basic information of 
891 passengers of the Titanic. Information such as, Spouses, Children, whether he survived or not, 
class, their name, age, ticket number and so on. We will try to display all this information in a easy 
way, so you can understand easily what happened there.


## Design

I've displayed two main graphs, bar and bubble plot. 


### Bar Plot

First one is a bar char in which you can see the porcentage or survival 
against deceased people in the titanic disaster. You have the options of change the x axis amongo the 
class of the passenger, the sex, number of Siblings or Spouse, port embarked and number of partner or 
children.

### Bubble Plot

In the second graph you can see a bubble graph where the bubbles represent the survived or deceased 
people in the titanic against the gender.

## Feedback
I think narrative makes sense. It is clear you want to show all the information comparing deceasaed 
and survived people. You should make clear the buttons function, as SibSp and Parch is not clear. 
You can give a little more information in the axis.
