# Make Effective Data Visualization


## Summary

We can see the most important data from Titanic Disaster.This data set contains basic information of 
891 passengers of the Titanic. Information such as, Spouses, Children, whether he survived or not, 
class, their name, age, ticket number and so on. We will try to display all this information in a easy 
way, so you can understand easily what happened there.


## Design

I've displayed two main graphs, bar and bubble plot. I used as first design the bars plot, as it fix perfectly
with my idea of comparing deceased and survived people. With the help of buttons I provide the user a
easy way to switch among data. 


### Bar Plot

First one is a bar char in which you can see the porcentage or survived people against deceased people 
in the titanic disaster. I do this comparing the number of deceased/survived people against the 
class of the passenger, the sex, number of Siblings or Spouse, age, port embarked and number of partner or 
children.

With help of the top buttons you can switch among all this options, getting a clear display of this information.

### Bubble Plot

In the second graph you can see a bubble graph where the bubbles represent the survived or deceased 
people in the titanic against the other data (number of deceased/survived people against the 
class of the passenger, the sex, age, number of Siblings or Spouse, port embarked and number of partner or 
children). It is interesting to compare the difference between both
gendre, as there were far more male deceased than femaled deceased. Actually you can appreciate in the plot
that there were much more male deceased than male survived and there were more female survived than deceased.

There are other interesting data, as Class. You can appreciate the difference among the class, in the first class
there were more survived poeple than deceased, however in the third class it's the opposite.

## Feedback
Alvaro G.(version 1): "I think narrative makes sense. It is clear you want to show all the information comparing deceasaed 
and survived people. You should make clear the buttons function, as SibSp and Parch is not clear. 
You can give a little more information in the axis."

Sergio A.(version 1): "I think your visualization and story is very clear. I would give more information in the second graph,
you might compare the age as well. I find quite interesting the way you compare all the data in the first
graph. ;)"

Laura P.(version 2): "At first sight, graph No. 1 seems quite clear and there is no need for some extra information. However, 
the second graph is a bit confusing, as it is not easy to see the exact age of the passengers.  It would 
be helpful if you indicate how to see more details by clicking on the bubble"
